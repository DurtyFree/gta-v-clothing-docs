<h1>Durty Cloth Tool v2.5.0</h1>
<h2>:bookmark_tabs: Important Project Migration Note</h2>
<p>This update changes the way your cloth project is saved and referenced cloth models and textures are managed internally.<br>Due to this change, on first time loading a older project, it will be automatically migrated to the new project format without any needed input from you. As this could take some while, you will be prompted with a dialog to confirm this.</p>
<p>In this process all your previously added, 'linked', clothes will be copied to a by Cloth Tool managed "data" folder.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>?? New projects format &amp; file/data handling</h3>
<p>All <strong>files related to a cloth project will be saved &amp; managed in one single folder</strong>, that could easily be shared &amp; does prevent accidentally building files to some unwanted location, deleting hundreds of files in advance (People selected Desktop as output and files got deleted there..).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Durty Cloth Tool will manage all files added to your project on its own, which <strong>takes you the hassle to manage all imported files on your own</strong> and removes cases where you accidentally deleted a file used in any of your cloth projects, breaking it completely.</li>
  <li>Files that are added to the project will now be imported to a "data" subfolder of your output folder defined in the build settings</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>?? Dynamic config builders</h3>
<p>The Dynamic Config Builder options are here to <strong>provide you all the configuration files</strong> you need to work with framework plugins like xnTattoos, qb-tattooshop, ESX-TattooShop, or any other similar config files.</p>

<h2>?? Technical explaination for new project data keeping</h2>
<p>In previous versions, as soon as you add any drawable or texture file, a reference to this file has been saved. This reference is the full file path leading to the file you have selected.<br>Basically it is not adding the drawable, its just <i>linking</i> to it. This behaviour is not common for applications that look like managing files, like Durty Cloth Tool does.</p>
<p><strong>This can and does cause issues like</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>moving the whole clothes project file is nearly to impossible if not properly managed on your own</li>
  <li>you will have to take care of managing files properly, because if not done properly you could end up deleting files from your disk that are used in any cloth project</li>
  <li>new people can run into issues like; downloading clothes from the internet, then selecting the drawable file in the downloads folder. When file gets overwritten or deleted in the future, it will just break cloth projects</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>It does bring some pros tho</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>"Experienced" users that are aware of the possible issues can manage clothes for multiple cloth projects that share the same cloth files (If this is a use case?)</li>
  <li>Possible duplicate of same cloth files on the disk can be prevented (saves some disk space)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>change introduced with this version</strong> is that adding a drawable or texture file, will basically import (copy) the file into a by the cloth tool managed "data" folder.<br>This will make managing clothes files a no-brainer as people will not have to pay any attention to that anymore. The cloth tool will manage all files in a folder and delete them there if they are unused, while making sure to not delete it instantly (so you could still delete clothes from your project for testing, exit the tool and load the project again and they would be there again.).</p>
<p>People could still setup &amp; manage "raw/source" folders if wanted to keep the original files somewhere, to add from that. Imported / managed files by Durty Cloth Tool will receive cryptic hash names like <code>936DA01F-9ABD-4D9D-80C7-02AF85C822A8.ydd</code> as it is not meant to manually delete, edit or replace files in the data folder.</p>

<h1>Durty Cloth Tool v2.3.0</h1>
<h2>Important License Note</h2>
<p><strong>As this update changes the way licenses are generated and processed, you might have to update your HWID with the new one from the tool and update it on the website + download a new license</strong></p>
<p><i>Visit the </i><a href="https://forge.plebmasters.de/account?tab=licenses"><i>Pleb Masters: Forge licenses</i></a><i> page to update your HWID and redownload your license</i><br><i>Find a detailed article on how to download and use your license </i><a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/how-to-receive-59448712"><i>on patreon</i></a></p>
<h2>Update highlights</h2>
<p>This update contains a lot of fixes that improve the overall experience with the tool and should resolve many of the reported issues I received.<br>Besides many small additions, this update also contains some big new additions that I will highlight below.</p>
<h3>Crash fixes, fixes and more fixes</h3>
<p>Thanks to all reports the past weeks, many of the issues that people experienced got fixed with this update. Including many things that possibly caused game crashes.<br>Please keep in mind I am not able to fix the crashes and issues caused by loading too many <i>.YMT files in the latest game DLC / update. This limit has to be increased either bei R</i> Games themselves on the next updates or by the multiplayer platform of your choice.</p>
<p>Anyway I have added an option that disables the generation of extra .YMTs that are needed to make high heels, cutting hairs and other stuff possible. Using this can help you shrink down the amount of .YMT files generated, but will make the listed features not work anymore.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ldSzKFf.png" alt=""></figure>
<p><br><i>See </i><a href="https://github.com/DurtyFree/durty-cloth-tool/wiki/YMT-game-limit-and-crash-issues"><i>this</i></a><i> wiki article for more information regarding the game YMT files limit</i></p>
<h3>Addon Tattoos</h3>
<p>This update introduces the first version of being able to easily manage your addon tattoos with the tool. By pressing Add in the tool, you will receive a list of options which now include "Add tattoo". Tattoos can be created from whatever image file you prefer; *.png, *.jpg, *.dds, *.tga, *.bmp or even .ytd files from already existing tattoos. The tool will automatically optimize your tattoo images for the game and create all needed files that are needed. In the game the item Name will represent the tattoo hash / name and the collection name is represented by the name you have gave the collection in the build window.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0Qj1gdV.png" alt=""></figure>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4PfCC1x.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Item warnings</h3>
<p>From now on you will see possible warnings for your cloth items in form of an exclamation mark directly in front of the related item. This helps finding cause of issues ahead of time faster and more reliable.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/660140449729740811/931731808771534868/unknown.png" alt=""></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Build progress bar &amp; cancel builds</h3>
<p>To improve the cloth building experience I have added a build progress indicator, which will give you detailed information about the current state of build and the possibility to cancel the build at any time. Additionally the application remains responsive at any time.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/390250138502823937/931336904509628537/trVbgyrULf.gif" alt=""></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Cloth physics &amp; Audio presets</h3>
<p>You can now add related *.YLD files for your clothes, which basically describe physics movement for your clothes.<br>Additionally I have added the possibility to the define an audio preset for your clothes. You will be able to select from all the currently existing audio presets for your drawable type of choice. This will for example change the sound of your shoes when you are walking to proper high heel sounds and similar.</p>
